description: 'Preview changes locally to update your docs'
---

<Info>
  **Prerequisite**: Please install Node.js (version 19 or higher) before proceeding. <br />
  Please upgrade to ```docs.json``` before proceeding and delete the legacy ```mint.json``` file.
</Info>

Follow these steps to install and run Mintlify on your operating system:

**Step 1**: Install Mintlify:

<CodeGroup>

  ```bash npm
  npm i -g mintlify
  ```

```bash yarn
yarn global add mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

**Step 2**: Navigate to the docs directory (where the `docs.json` file is located) and execute the following command:

```bash
mintlify dev
```

A local preview of your documentation will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Custom Ports

By default, Mintlify uses port 3000. You can customize the port Mintlify runs on by using the `--port` flag. To run Mintlify on port 3333, for instance, use this command:

```bash
mintlify dev --port 3333
```

If you attempt to run Mintlify on a port that's already in use, it will use the next available port:

```md
Port 3000 is already in use. Trying 3001 instead.
```

## Backend Development (sssync-bknd)

The sssync backend is a NestJS application located in the `sssync-bknd` directory. To contribute to backend development, you'll need Node.js (v18 or higher recommended) and npm/yarn.

**1. Navigate to the Backend Directory:**
```bash
cd ../sssync-bknd # Adjust path if your docs are nested deeper
```

**2. Install Dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

**3. Environment Variables:**
   - The backend requires environment variables for configuration (e.g., database connections, API keys, Supabase config).
   - Create a `.env` file in the `sssync-bknd` root directory by copying from `.env.example` (if it exists) or by creating a new one.
   - Populate the `.env` file with the necessary values. Key variables include:
     ```env
     SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
     SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key
     SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_supabase_service_role_key
     DATABASE_URL=your_database_url # Often derived from Supabase settings
     JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
     # ... other platform API keys and configurations
     ```

**4. Run the Development Server:**
```bash
npm run start:dev
# or
yarn start:dev
```
This command usually starts the NestJS application with hot-reloading, typically on `http://localhost:3001` (or another configured port).

**5. Project Structure:**
For a detailed overview of the backend's architecture and directory layout, please refer to the [Backend Project Structure](./essentials/project-structure.mdx) page.

**Key Backend Technologies:**
*   **NestJS:** A progressive Node.js framework for building efficient, reliable and scalable server-side applications.
*   **TypeScript:** Strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript.
*   **Supabase:** Used for database and authentication.
*   **BullMQ:** For managing background jobs and queues (e.g., for sync processes).

**Common Development Tasks:**
*   **Adding a new API endpoint:** Create or update a controller, service, and DTOs within the relevant module.
*   **Modifying business logic:** Update the appropriate service file.
*   **Database schema changes:** Manage these through Supabase Studio or migrations.
*   **Working with background jobs:** Interact with BullMQ queues and processors.

## Mintlify Versions

Please note that each CLI release is associated with a specific version of Mintlify. If your local website doesn't align with the production version, please update the CLI:

<CodeGroup>

```bash npm
npm i -g mintlify@latest
```

```bash yarn
yarn global upgrade mintlify
```

</CodeGroup>

## Validating Links

The CLI can assist with validating reference links made in your documentation. To identify any broken links, use the following command:

```bash
mintlify broken-links
```

## Deployment

<Tip>
  Unlimited editors available under the [Pro
  Plan](https://mintlify.com/pricing) and above.
</Tip>

If the deployment is successful, you should see the following:

<Frame>
  <img src="/images/checks-passed.png" style={{ borderRadius: '0.5rem' }} />
</Frame>

## Code Formatting

We suggest using extensions on your IDE to recognize and format MDX. If you're a VSCode user, consider the [MDX VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=unifiedjs.vscode-mdx) for syntax highlighting, and [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode) for code formatting.

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title='Error: Could not load the "sharp" module using the darwin-arm64 runtime'>

    This may be due to an outdated version of node. Try the following:
    1. Remove the currently-installed version of mintlify: `npm remove -g mintlify`
    2. Upgrade to Node v19 or higher.
    3. Reinstall mintlify: `npm install -g mintlify`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Issue: Encountering an unknown error">
  
    Solution: Go to the root of your device and delete the \~/.mintlify folder. Afterwards, run `mintlify dev` again.
