This section outlines the API endpoints used for authenticating with Shopify. It follows the standard OAuth 2.0 authorization code grant flow. These endpoints facilitate connecting a user's Shopify store to sssync.

## Shopify Login

Initiates the Shopify OAuth login process for a specific shop. Your application should direct the user to this endpoint as the first step to connect their Shopify store.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/shopify/login`

**Expected Query Parameters:**
*   `userId` (string, required): Your system's unique identifier for the user. This is stored in the state token and used later to associate the Shopify connection with the correct sssync user.
*   `shop` (string, required): The Shopify shop name (e.g., `your-shop.myshopify.com`). This is required by Shopify to identify the target store for authorization.
*   `finalRedirectUri` (string, optional): A URL (often a deep link for mobile apps, or a specific path in your web app) where the user should be redirected *after* the entire OAuth flow (including the callback to `/auth/shopify/oauth-callback`) is successfully completed. If not provided, a default redirect URI configured in the backend will be used.

**Example Request:**

Your application redirects the user's browser to:
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/login?userId=user-xyz-789&shop=examplestore.myshopify.com&finalRedirectUri=yourapp%3A%2F%2Fshopify-auth-complete
```

Simulating with `curl` (shows headers, actual response is a redirect):
```bash
curl -X GET "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/login?userId=user-xyz-789&shop=examplestore.myshopify.com&finalRedirectUri=yourapp%3A%2F%2Fshopify-auth-complete" -v
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** The browser (or client) will be redirected to Shopify's authorization page. The `Location` header will contain the Shopify URL. The user will then log in to Shopify (if not already) and approve the requested permissions for your app.

    **Example Success Response Headers:**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://examplestore.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_SHOPIFY_API_KEY&scope=read_products,write_products,read_inventory,write_inventory&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR_API_DOMAIN%2Fauth%2Fshopify%2Foauth-callback&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT_FOR_USER_XYZ_789_AND_SHOP
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 400 Bad Request):** If `userId` or `shop` are missing, an error response with details will be returned. The backend might also redirect to an error page or the `finalRedirectUri` with error query parameters if there's a configuration issue (e.g., Shopify App details not set up correctly on the backend).

    **Example Error Response (400 Bad Request if `shop` is missing):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8

    {
      "statusCode": 400,
      "message": "Missing required query parameter: shop",
      "error": "Bad Request"
    }
    ```

## Shopify OAuth Callback

This endpoint is the one Shopify redirects the user to after they have authorized (or denied) your application on the Shopify platform. It handles the exchange of the authorization `code` for an access token and stores the Shopify connection details.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/shopify/oauth-callback`

**Expected Query Parameters (from Shopify):**
*   `code` (string, required on success): The authorization code provided by Shopify upon successful user authorization.
*   `shop` (string, required): The Shopify shop name.
*   `state` (string, required): A unique string previously generated by your application (during the `/auth/shopify/login` step) and passed to Shopify. This is used to prevent CSRF attacks and to retrieve session information, such as the `userId` and `finalRedirectUri`.
*   `hmac` (string, required): A hash-based message authentication code used by Shopify to verify the authenticity of the callback request. Your backend must validate this HMAC.
*   `timestamp` (string, required): The timestamp when Shopify generated the request.

**Example Incoming Request from Shopify (URL called by Shopify):**

Successful authorization:
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/oauth-callback?code=SHOPIFY_AUTH_CODE&hmac=GENERATED_HMAC&shop=examplestore.myshopify.com&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT&timestamp=1678886400
```
User denies authorization:
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/oauth-callback?error=access_denied&shop=examplestore.myshopify.com&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT&timestamp=1678886405
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** The browser will be redirected to the `finalRedirectUri` (which was originally passed to `/auth/shopify/login` and stored in the state). This URI will typically include query parameters indicating success.

    **Example Success Response Headers (Redirect to `finalRedirectUri`):
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: yourapp://shopify-auth-complete?connection=shopify&status=success&shop=examplestore.myshopify.com
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 302 Found with error params, or HTTP 400/401/500):**
    *   If HMAC verification fails or the state is invalid/expired, the user will be redirected to the `finalRedirectUri` (or a default error page) with query parameters indicating the error.
    *   If required parameters like `code` or `shop` are missing, an HTTP 400 Bad Request might be returned directly.
    *   If server-side configuration is missing (e.g., Shopify API secret), an HTTP 500 Internal Server Error might occur, though often this also results in a redirect with an error message.

    **Example Error Response Headers (Redirect on HMAC failure):
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: yourapp://shopify-auth-complete?connection=shopify&status=error&message=Authentication+failed+HMAC+invalid
    ```

## Initiate Shopify Store Picker

This endpoint is primarily for client applications (like mobile apps) where the user might have multiple Shopify stores and needs to select one *before* starting the OAuth flow for a specific shop. It redirects the user to a Shopify-hosted page where they can log in (if needed) and pick the store they want to connect.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/shopify/initiate-store-picker`

**Expected Query Parameters:**
*   `userId` (string, required): Your system's unique identifier for the user.
*   `finalRedirectUri` (string, required): The URI (often a custom scheme for mobile apps like `yourapp://auth/callback`) where Shopify Accounts should redirect the user *after* they have selected a store. This URI will receive the chosen `shop` and a `state` parameter.

**Example Request:**

Your application redirects the user's browser to:
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/initiate-store-picker?userId=user-xyz-789&finalRedirectUri=yourapp%3A%2F%2Fshopify-store-picked
```

Simulating with `curl`:
```bash
curl -X GET "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/initiate-store-picker?userId=user-xyz-789&finalRedirectUri=yourapp%3A%2F%2Fshopify-store-picked" -v
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** Redirects the user to the Shopify Accounts store picker/login page. The `Location` header will contain this Shopify URL.

    **Example Success Response Headers:**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://accounts.shopify.com/store-picker?client_id=YOUR_SHOPIFY_API_KEY&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR_API_DOMAIN%2Fauth%2Fshopify%2Fstore-picker-callback&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT_FOR_USER_XYZ_789_AND_FINALREDIRECTURI
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 400 Bad Request):** If `userId` or `finalRedirectUri` are missing or invalid, an error is returned. The backend may also redirect to `finalRedirectUri` with error parameters if there's a configuration issue.

## Shopify Store Picker Callback

After the user selects a store on the Shopify Accounts page (initiated by `/auth/shopify/initiate-store-picker`), Shopify redirects them to this intermediate callback URI (`/auth/shopify/store-picker-callback` itself). This endpoint then takes the selected `shop` and the `state` (which contains the original `userId` and the app's `finalRedirectUri`) to construct the final, shop-specific OAuth URL (similar to what `/auth/shopify/login` would generate) and redirects the user to it.

This effectively chains the store selection into the standard OAuth flow for the chosen shop.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/shopify/store-picker-callback`

**Expected Query Parameters (from Shopify Accounts):**
*   `shop` (string, required): The Shopify shop name selected by the user (e.g., `selected-store.myshopify.com`).
*   `state` (string, required): The state parameter originally created by your application during the `/auth/shopify/initiate-store-picker` step. It's crucial for retrieving the `userId` and the true `finalRedirectUri` for the app.

**Example Incoming Request from Shopify Accounts (URL called by Shopify):**
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/shopify/store-picker-callback?shop=selected-store.myshopify.com&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT_FROM_INITIATE_PICKER
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** Redirects the user to the shop-specific Shopify authorization URL (the same URL they would have been sent to if `/auth/shopify/login` was called directly with the selected shop). The user then proceeds with the standard Shopify app authorization for that store.

    **Example Success Response Headers:**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://selected-store.myshopify.com/admin/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_SHOPIFY_API_KEY&scope=read_products,write_products,read_inventory,write_inventory&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR_API_DOMAIN%2Fauth%2Fshopify%2Foauth-callback&state=REGENERATED_STATE_JWT_FOR_SELECTED_SHOP_AND_FINALREDIRECTURI
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 302 Found with error params, or HTTP 400/500):** If the `state` is invalid or `shop` is missing, the user is typically redirected to a default frontend error page or the app's `finalRedirectUri` with error parameters.

    **Example Error Response Headers (Redirect on invalid state):
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: yourapp://shopify-store-picked?status=error&message=Invalid+state+during+store+picker+callback
    ```
