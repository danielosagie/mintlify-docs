This section covers API endpoints related to user management, such as updating user profiles, subscriptions, or other user-specific settings.

## Update User Subscription Tier

Allows an administrator (or an appropriately authorized user/service) to change the subscription tier for a given user.

**Method & Path:** `PATCH /users/{userId}/subscription`

**Purpose:**
To modify the subscription plan associated with a specific user account. This is typically an administrative action used to upgrade, downgrade, or otherwise change a user's access level based on their subscription status. The endpoint requires the `userId` of the target user and the `subscriptionTierId` of the new tier.

**Important Security Note:** This endpoint **MUST** be protected by a robust authorization mechanism (e.g., an Admin Guard, or role-based access control that verifies the caller has administrative privileges). Exposing this without proper security could lead to unauthorized changes in user subscriptions.

**Request:**
*   **Headers:** `Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN>`
*   **Path Parameter**: `userId` (string, UUID, required): The unique identifier of the user whose subscription tier is to be updated.
*   **Request Body**: The request body must conform to the `UpdateSubscriptionDto` schema, containing the new subscription tier ID.

**Example Request:**

Replace `{userId}` with the actual user ID (e.g., `user-uuid-target-123`).
```bash
curl -X PATCH "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/users/user-uuid-target-123/subscription" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ADMIN_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ 
       "subscriptionTierId": "tier-uuid-premium-789"
     }'
```

**Response:**
- `204 No Content`: The user's subscription tier was successfully updated. No content is returned in the response body.

- `400 Bad Request`: The request body is invalid (e.g., `subscriptionTierId` is missing or not a valid UUID). Refer to `#/components/responses/BadRequest` in `openapi.json`.
    **Example Error Response Body (400 Bad Request):**
    ```json
    {
      "statusCode": 400,
      "message": [
        "subscriptionTierId must be a UUID"
      ],
      "error": "Bad Request"
    }
    ```

- `401 Unauthorized`: Authentication token is missing, invalid, or expired. Refer to `#/components/responses/Unauthorized` in `openapi.json`.
    **Example Error Response Body (401 Unauthorized):**
    ```json
    {
      "statusCode": 401,
      "message": "Unauthorized"
    }
    ```

- `403 Forbidden`: The authenticated user/service does not have the necessary permissions to update another user's subscription (e.g., not an administrator). The response body may conform to `#/components/schemas/Error`.
    **Example Error Response Body (403 Forbidden):**
    ```json
    {
      "statusCode": 403,
      "message": "Forbidden resource",
      "error": "Forbidden"
    }
    ```

- `404 Not Found`: The specified `userId` does not exist, or the `subscriptionTierId` does not correspond to a valid tier. The response body may conform to `#/components/schemas/Error`.
    **Example Error Response Body (404 Not Found - User):**
    ```json
    {
      "statusCode": 404,
      "message": "User with ID user-uuid-target-123 not found",
      "error": "Not Found"
    }
    ```

- `500 Internal Server Error`: An unexpected error occurred on the server.

Refer to `openapi.json` for detailed schema definitions for `UpdateSubscriptionDto` and error responses.
