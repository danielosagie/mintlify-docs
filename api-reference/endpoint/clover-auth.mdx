This section describes the API endpoints for authenticating with Clover's services. This involves initiating the OAuth 2.0 flow and handling the callback from Clover after user authorization.

## Clover Login

Redirects the user to Clover to authorize the application. This is the first step in the Clover OAuth 2.0 flow for connecting a merchant's Clover account to sssync.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/clover/login`

**Expected Query Parameters:**
*   `userId` (string, required): Your system's unique identifier for the user. This is embedded in the `state` parameter sent to Clover and used later to associate the Clover connection with the correct sssync user account.
*   `finalRedirectUri` (string, optional): A URL where the user should be redirected *after* the entire Clover OAuth flow is successfully completed (including the callback to `/auth/clover/oauth-callback`). If not provided, a default URI is used.

**Example Request:**

A client application would typically redirect the user's browser to this URL. Here's how you might construct the URL:

```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/clover/login?userId=user-abc-123&finalRedirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Fyourapp.com%2Fclover-oauth-return
```

If you were to simulate this with `curl` (note: `-v` shows headers, the actual response is a redirect):

```bash
curl -X GET "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/clover/login?userId=user-abc-123&finalRedirectUri=https%3A%2F%2Fyourapp.com%2Fclover-oauth-return" -v
```

**What you get back (Response):**

*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** The browser (or client) is redirected to Clover's authorization server. The `Location` header of this redirect will contain the Clover URL. The merchant will log in to their Clover account and approve the requested permissions.

    **Example Success Response Headers:**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://www.clover.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=YOUR_CLOVER_APP_ID&redirect_uri=https%3A%2F%2FYOUR_API_DOMAIN%2Fauth%2Fclover%2Foauth-callback&response_type=code&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT

    X-Frame-Options: DENY
    Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:00 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 400 Bad Request / HTTP 302 Found with error params):** If `userId` is missing, a 400 error might occur. If there are backend configuration issues for Clover integration, the system might redirect to an error page or the `finalRedirectUri` with error details.

    **Example Error Response (400 Bad Request if `userId` is missing):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 60
    Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:01 GMT

    {
      "statusCode": 400,
      "message": "Missing required query parameter: userId",
      "error": "Bad Request"
    }
    ```
    **Example Error Redirect (to `finalRedirectUri`):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://yourapp.com/clover-oauth-return?connection=clover&status=error&message=Configuration+issue
    ```

## Clover OAuth Callback

This endpoint is the designated redirect URI that Clover calls after the user has granted or denied permission to your application. It receives an authorization `code` (on success) or error details from Clover.

**Method & Path:** `GET /auth/clover/oauth-callback`

**Expected Query Parameters (from Clover):**
*   `code` (string, optional): The authorization code from Clover if the user approved the request. This code is then exchanged for an access token.
*   `state` (string, required): The unique state string that your application initially sent to Clover during the `/auth/clover/login` step. This is crucial for validating the request's origin (CSRF protection) and retrieving `userId` and `finalRedirectUri`.
*   `merchant_id` (string, optional): The Clover merchant ID, provided by Clover on successful authorization.
*   `client_id` (string, optional): Your application's Clover client ID, echoed back by Clover.
*   If the user denies authorization or an error occurs on Clover's side, `code` and `merchant_id` might be absent, and error-related parameters might be present instead (e.g., `error`, `error_description`).

**Example Incoming Request from Clover (URL called by Clover):**

```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/clover/oauth-callback?code=CLOVER_AUTHORIZATION_CODE&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT&merchant_id=CLOVER_MERCHANT_ID&client_id=YOUR_CLOVER_APP_ID
```
Or, in case of user denial:
```
https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/auth/clover/oauth-callback?error=access_denied&error_description=The+user+denied+your+request&state=GENERATED_STATE_JWT
```

**What you get back (Response):**

*   **On Success (HTTP 302 Found):** The browser is redirected to the `finalRedirectUri` (originally passed to `/auth/clover/login` and stored in the state). This URI will usually include query parameters indicating success.

    **Example Success Response Headers (Redirect to `finalRedirectUri`):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://yourapp.com/clover-oauth-return?connection=clover&status=success&userId=user-abc-123
    Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:02 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```

*   **On Error (HTTP 302 Found with error params, or HTTP 400/401/500):**
    *   If the `state` is invalid/expired, or if Clover returns an error (e.g., user denied access), the user is redirected to the `finalRedirectUri` (or a default error page) with query parameters detailing the error.
    *   If essential parameters like `state` are missing from Clover's callback, an HTTP 400 Bad Request might be returned.

    **Example Error Response Headers (Redirect to `finalRedirectUri` on State Mismatch):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 302 Found
    Location: https://yourapp.com/clover-oauth-return?connection=clover&status=error&message=Invalid+state+or+OAuth+flow+failed
    Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:03 GMT
    Connection: keep-alive
    ```
    **Example Error Response (400 Bad Request if `state` is missing):**
    ```http
    HTTP/1.1 400 Bad Request
    Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
    Content-Length: 55
    Date: Mon, 01 Jul 2024 12:00:04 GMT

    {
      "statusCode": 400,
      "message": "Missing required query parameter: state",
      "error": "Bad Request"
    }
    ```
