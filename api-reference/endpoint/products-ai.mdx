openapiPath: '../openapi.json'

This section details endpoints that leverage AI for product creation and enrichment. These tools help in analyzing product images and generating detailed product information.

All endpoints in this section require authentication (JWT Bearer token) and are subject to rate limiting and feature usage checks based on the user's subscription plan.

## Analyze Product Images

This endpoint is the starting point for AI-assisted product listing. It takes one or more image URIs, performs image recognition (e.g., through Google Lens integration via SerpApi), creates a draft `Product` and `ProductVariant` in the sssync system, and stores the initial analysis results (like visual matches from the web or text extracted from images).

This allows the user to then review the visual matches and proceed to generate more detailed product information using the `/products/generate-details` endpoint.

**Method & Path:** `POST /products/analyze`

**Expected Headers:**
*   `Authorization`: `Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`

**Request Body (`AnalyzeImagesDto`):**
*   `imageUris` (Array of strings, required): An array of publicly accessible URLs pointing to the product images. The first image is typically treated as the primary image for analysis.
*   `selectedPlatforms` (Array of strings, required): An array of platform keys (e.g., `["shopify", "amazon"]`) indicating for which platforms the AI should eventually generate tailored details. This might influence the type of analysis performed.

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/products/analyze" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ 
       "imageUris": [
         "https://example.com/image1.jpg", 
         "https://example.com/image2.png"
       ],
       "selectedPlatforms": ["shopify", "ebay"]
     }'
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 200 OK):** An object containing:
    *   `product`: A `SimpleProduct` object representing the newly created draft product.
    *   `variant`: A `SimpleProductVariant` object for the newly created draft variant associated with the product.
    *   `analysis` (Optional): A `SimpleAiGeneratedContent` object if any initial structured analysis (like visual matches) was saved.

    **Example Success Response Body (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "product": {
        "Id": "prod-uuid-123",

      }
    }
    ```
    *Refer to `openapi.json` for `SimpleProduct`, `SimpleProductVariant`, and `SimpleAiGeneratedContent` schema definitions if available, or backend service definitions.* 

*   **On Error (HTTP 400 Bad Request):** If `imageUris` is empty or `selectedPlatforms` is missing.
    **Example Error Response Body (400 Bad Request):**
    ```json
    {
      "statusCode": 400,
      "message": [
        "imageUris should not be empty",
        "selectedPlatforms should not be empty"
      ],
      "error": "Bad Request"
    }
    ```
*   **On Error (HTTP 401 Unauthorized):** Invalid or missing JWT.
*   **On Error (HTTP 402 Payment Required / 429 Too Many Requests):** If the user exceeds their plan's AI scan limits or hits rate limits.
    **Example Error Response Body (402 Payment Required):**
    ```json
    {
        "statusCode": 402,
        "message": "AI scan limit exceeded for your current plan.",
        "error": "Payment Required"
    }
    ```
*   **On Error (HTTP 500 Internal Server Error):** For unexpected issues during analysis or database operations.

## Generate AI Product Details

After a product image has been analyzed and a draft product/variant exists (via the `/products/analyze` endpoint), this endpoint generates rich product details using AI. It takes the `productId`, `variantId`, image URIs, the index of the cover image, target platforms, and an optional `selectedMatch` (a visual match chosen by the user from the analysis step) to guide the AI in generating relevant titles, descriptions, tags, pricing suggestions, and other platform-specific attributes.

**Method & Path:** `POST /products/generate-details`

**Expected Headers:**
*   `Authorization`: `Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>`

**Request Body (`GenerateDetailsDto`):**
*   `productId` (string, UUID, required): The ID of the draft product created by the `/analyze` endpoint.
*   `variantId` (string, UUID, required): The ID of the draft variant created by the `/analyze` endpoint.
*   `imageUris` (Array of strings, required): Publicly accessible URLs of product images. Essential for the AI to "see" the product.
*   `coverImageIndex` (integer, required): The index (0-based) in `imageUris` that represents the main/cover image.
*   `selectedPlatforms` (Array of strings, required): Platform keys (e.g., `["shopify", "ebay"]`) for which the AI should generate tailored details.
*   `selectedMatch` (Object, optional): If the user selected a specific visual match from the `/analyze` step, providing its details here (`position`, `title`, `link`, `source`) can significantly improve the relevance of AI-generated content.

**Example Request:**
```bash
curl -X POST "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/products/generate-details" \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{ 
       "productId": "prod-uuid-123",
       "variantId": "var-uuid-456",
       "imageUris": [
         "https://example.com/image1.jpg", 
         "https://example.com/image2.png"
       ],
       "coverImageIndex": 0,
       "selectedPlatforms": ["shopify", "ebay"],
       "selectedMatch": {
         "position": 1,
         "title": "Very Similar Blue Widget on ExampleRetailer",
         "link": "https://exampleretailer.com/blue-widget",
         "source": "ExampleRetailer.com"
       }
     }'
```

**What you get back (Response):**
*   **On Success (HTTP 200 OK):** An object containing:
    *   `generatedDetails` (Object or null): An object where keys are platform names (e.g., `shopify`, `amazon`) and values are `GeneratedPlatformSpecificDetails` objects containing AI-generated titles, descriptions, tags, etc. Returns `null` if AI generation fails or produces no usable content.

    **Example Success Response Body (200 OK):**
    ```json
    {
      "generatedDetails": {
        "shopify": {
          "title": "Amazing Blue Widget - Special Edition",

      }
    }
    ```
    *The structure of `GeneratedPlatformSpecificDetails` will vary based on the platform and the AI's output. Refer to backend service definitions for expected fields.* 

*   **On Error (HTTP 400 Bad Request):** If required fields are missing (e.g., `productId`, `variantId`, `imageUris`) or if `coverImageIndex` is invalid.
*   **On Error (HTTP 401 Unauthorized):** Invalid or missing JWT.
*   **On Error (HTTP 402 Payment Required / 429 Too Many Requests):** If AI usage limits are exceeded.
