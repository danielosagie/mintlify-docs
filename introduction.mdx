description: 'API Reference for the sssync Node.js/NestJS backend, enabling multi-channel e-commerce synchronization.'
---

## Welcome to the sssync API

This API reference provides detailed information about the sssync backend API. Our backend is built with **Node.js** and the **NestJS framework**, using TypeScript. It is designed to power the sssync application, facilitating seamless product and inventory synchronization across multiple e-commerce platforms like Shopify, Square, and Clover.

### Target Audience

This documentation is intended for developers integrating with the sssync API, including:

-   Frontend developers building client applications (web, mobile) for sssync.
-   Backend developers extending sssync or integrating it with other systems.
-   Third-party developers looking to interact with sssync platform data.

### Key Features Powered by this API

-   **Authentication**: Securely manage user sessions and platform connections.
-   **Platform Connections**: Connect and manage links to various e-commerce platforms.
-   **Product Management**: Create, retrieve, and manage a canonical product catalog.
-   **AI-Powered Product Enrichment**: Analyze product images and generate detailed product information.
-   **Synchronization Engine**: Initiate and monitor data synchronization processes.
-   **Webhook Handling**: Receive and process real-time updates from connected platforms.

### API Design & Conventions

-   **RESTful Architecture**: The API generally follows REST principles.
-   **JSON Payloads**: Request and response bodies are primarily in JSON format.
-   **Standard HTTP Methods**: Uses `GET`, `POST`, `PATCH`, `DELETE` appropriately.
-   **Standard HTTP Status Codes**: Returns appropriate status codes for success, client errors, and server errors.

## Authentication

Most API endpoints are protected and require authentication. The sssync backend primarily uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Bearer tokens** for authenticating API requests. These tokens are typically obtained through an authentication flow managed by Supabase Auth.

To authenticate your API calls, include the JWT in the `Authorization` header with the `Bearer` scheme:

```http
Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
```

Endpoints that require authentication will be marked accordingly in their respective sections, and the `openapi.json` specification includes security scheme definitions for `bearerAuth`.
