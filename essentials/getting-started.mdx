This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the sssync backend project on your local machine.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: We recommend using the latest LTS version (check `.nvmrc` if available, or consult `package.json` engines).
-   **npm** or **yarn**: For managing project dependencies.
-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Supabase Account (Optional but Recommended)**: While the backend interacts with Supabase, for local development, you might use provided credentials for a development instance or set up your own. For full end-to-end testing, access to a Supabase project is beneficial.
-   **Access to Platform Developer Accounts (Optional)**: For testing specific platform integrations (Shopify, Clover, Square), you'll need developer accounts and API keys for those platforms.

## 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the `sssync-bknd` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd sssync-bknd
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm install
```
```bash yarn
yarn install
```
</CodeGroup>

## 3. Environment Configuration (`.env`)

The backend uses environment variables for configuration, including database connections, API keys, and other sensitive settings. You'll need to create a `.env` file in the root of the `sssync-bknd` project.

Copy the example environment file (if one exists, e.g., `.env.example`) or create a new `.env` file and populate it with the necessary values. Key variables typically include:

```env
# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_or_service_role_key # Use service_role for backend operations
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret # Found in your Supabase project's auth settings

# Application Configuration
PORT=3001 # Or your preferred port for the backend server
NODE_ENV=development
ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key_for_data_encryption # Must be 32 bytes (e.g., 64 hex characters)

# JWT Configuration (alternative to Supabase JWT secret if custom JWTs are used for other purposes)
# JWT_SECRET=another_strong_secret_for_custom_jwts
# JWT_EXPIRY=3600s

# Platform API Keys & Secrets (obtain from respective developer portals)
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_shopify_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_shopify_api_secret_key
# SHOPIFY_APP_URL=your_app_url_for_shopify_callbacks (e.g., http://localhost:3001)

SQUARE_APP_ID=your_square_application_id
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token # For sandbox/development
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox # or production

CLOVER_APP_ID=your_clover_app_id
CLOVER_APP_SECRET=your_clover_app_secret

# Redis Configuration (for BullMQ task queue if used extensively)
# REDIS_HOST=localhost
# REDIS_PORT=6379
# REDIS_PASSWORD=

# Other service API keys (e.g., AI services)
# SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_for_image_recognition
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_for_ai_text_generation
```

**Important Notes on `.env`:**

-   **Never commit your `.env` file** to version control. It should be listed in your `.gitignore` file.
-   Obtain actual API keys and Supabase credentials from project administrators or your own developer accounts.
-   The `ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY` is critical for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data like platform credentials stored in the database. Ensure it's strong and kept secure.
-   The `SUPABASE_KEY` should generally be the `service_role` key for backend operations that require bypassing Row Level Security (RLS), but be mindful of its power.

## 4. Running the Application (Development Mode)

Once dependencies are installed and your `.env` file is configured, you can start the NestJS development server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run start:dev
```
```bash yarn
yarn start:dev
```
</CodeGroup>

This command typically starts the server with hot-reloading enabled, watching for file changes. By default, the application might run on `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).

## 5. Database Setup (Supabase)

-   Ensure your Supabase instance (either cloud or local via Supabase CLI) has the necessary tables and schema. Refer to any database migration scripts or schema definitions (`sssync-db.md` or SQL files) in the project.
-   If you're using a shared development Supabase instance, ensure your `.env` points to it correctly.
-   For a fresh Supabase project, you might need to run initial schema migrations.

## Next Steps

With the backend running, you can:

-   Explore the API endpoints using a tool like Postman or Insomnia (refer to the API Reference section of this documentation).
-   Connect a frontend application if available.
-   Start working on new features or bug fixes!

If you encounter any issues during setup, double-check your `.env` configuration, Node.js/npm versions, and consult with other team members or the project's issue tracker.
