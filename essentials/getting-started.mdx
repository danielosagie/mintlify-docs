This guide will walk you through the steps to set up and run the sssync backend project on your local machine. The backend is a Node.js application built with the NestJS framework and TypeScript.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

-   **Node.js**: We recommend using the latest LTS version. Check the `.nvmrc` file in the project root if available, or consult the `engines` section in `package.json` for the specific version. You can use a version manager like `nvm` to manage Node.js versions.
    ```bash
    # Example: Using nvm to install and use a specific version
    nvm install 18 # Or the version specified in .nvmrc
    nvm use 18
    ```
-   **npm** or **yarn**: For managing project dependencies. NestJS projects often come with a `package-lock.json` (for npm) or `yarn.lock` file. It's recommended to use the package manager that corresponds to the lock file present.
-   **Git**: For cloning the repository.
-   **Supabase Account (Optional but Recommended)**: While the backend interacts with Supabase, for local development, you might use provided credentials for a development instance or set up your own. For full end-to-end testing, access to a Supabase project is beneficial. You might also consider using the [Supabase CLI](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/cli) for local development and managing migrations.
-   **Access to Platform Developer Accounts (Optional)**: For testing specific platform integrations (Shopify, Clover, Square), you'll need developer accounts and API keys for those platforms.

## 1. Clone the Repository

If you haven't already, clone the `sssync-bknd` repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone <repository-url> # Replace <repository-url> with the actual Git URL
cd sssync-bknd
```

## 2. Install Dependencies

Install the project dependencies using npm or yarn. Check for `package-lock.json` (use npm) or `yarn.lock` (use yarn).

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
# If package-lock.json exists or you prefer npm
npm install
```
```bash yarn
# If yarn.lock exists or you prefer yarn
yarn install
```
</CodeGroup>

This will download all the necessary Node.js packages defined in `package.json` into the `node_modules` directory.

## 3. Environment Configuration (`.env`)

The backend uses environment variables for configuration, including database connections, API keys, JWT secrets, and other sensitive settings. NestJS applications commonly use the `dotenv` package (often via `@nestjs/config`) to load these variables from a `.env` file.

Create a `.env` file in the root of the `sssync-bknd` project. You can usually copy it from an example file if provided:

```bash
cp .env.example .env # If .env.example exists
```

Then, populate it with the necessary values. Key variables typically include:

```env
# Application Configuration
NODE_ENV=development
PORT=3001 # Or your preferred port for the backend server

# Supabase Configuration
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url
SUPABASE_KEY=your_supabase_anon_or_service_role_key # Use service_role for backend operations
SUPABASE_JWT_SECRET=your_supabase_jwt_secret # Found in your Supabase project's auth settings

# Security
ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY=a_very_strong_and_long_secret_key_for_data_encryption # Must be 32 bytes (e.g., 64 hex characters) for AES-256
# JWT_SECRET=another_strong_secret_for_custom_jwts_if_not_using_supabase_one
# JWT_EXPIRY=3600s

# Platform API Keys & Secrets (obtain from respective developer portals)
# Ensure these are kept secure and are for development/sandbox environments
SHOPIFY_API_KEY=your_shopify_api_key
SHOPIFY_API_SECRET=your_shopify_api_secret_key
SHOPIFY_APP_URL=http://localhost:3001 # Or your ngrok URL for local Shopify development

SQUARE_APP_ID=your_square_application_id
SQUARE_ACCESS_TOKEN=your_square_access_token # For sandbox/development
SQUARE_ENVIRONMENT=sandbox # or production

CLOVER_APP_ID=your_clover_app_id
CLOVER_APP_SECRET=your_clover_app_secret
CLOVER_API_URL=https://sandbox.dev.clover.com # For sandbox, use production URL for live

# Redis Configuration (if used for BullMQ, caching, etc.)
# REDIS_HOST=localhost
# REDIS_PORT=6379
# REDIS_PASSWORD=

# Other service API keys (e.g., AI services)
# SERPAPI_KEY=your_serpapi_key_for_image_recognition
# GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_for_ai_text_generation

# Logging (NestJS specific, if customized)
# LOG_LEVEL=debug
```

**Important Notes on `.env`:**

-   **Never commit your actual `.env` file** to version control. It should be listed in your `.gitignore` file.
-   Obtain actual API keys and Supabase credentials from project administrators or your own developer accounts for sandbox/test environments.
-   The `ENCRYPTION_SECRET_KEY` is critical for encrypting and decrypting sensitive data like platform credentials stored in the database. Ensure it's strong (e.g., generated by a password manager or `openssl rand -hex 32`) and kept secure.
-   For platform callbacks during OAuth flows (like Shopify), you might need to use a tool like `ngrok` to expose your local server to the internet and use the `ngrok` URL in your `.env` and platform app configurations.

## 4. Running the Application (Development Mode)

Once dependencies are installed and your `.env` file is configured, you can start the NestJS development server:

<CodeGroup>
```bash npm
npm run start:dev
```
```bash yarn
yarn start:dev
```
</CodeGroup>

This command, typically defined in `package.json`, starts the server using `nest start --watch`. It enables hot-reloading, so changes to your TypeScript files will automatically recompile and restart the server. By default, the application might run on `http://localhost:3001` (or the port specified in your `PORT` environment variable).

Look for output in your terminal indicating the server has started, e.g.:
```
[Nest] <timestamp> INFO [NestApplication] Nest application successfully started
[Nest] <timestamp> INFO [InstanceLoader] Nest microservice successfully started
[Nest] <timestamp> INFO RoutesResolver Nest application routes mapped
[Nest] <timestamp> INFO NestFactory Starting Nest application...
```

## 5. Key Scripts in `package.json`

Familiarize yourself with other useful scripts in the `package.json` file. Common ones in a NestJS project include:

-   `build`: Compiles the TypeScript project to JavaScript (usually in a `dist` folder).
    ```bash
    npm run build
    # or
    yarn build
    ```
-   `start`: Starts the application from the compiled JavaScript (used in production).
    ```bash
    npm run start
    # or
    yarn start
    ```
-   `start:prod`: Starts the application in production mode (often just `node dist/main`).
-   `lint`: Runs ESLint to check for code style issues.
    ```bash
    npm run lint
    # or
    yarn lint
    ```
-   `test`: Runs unit tests (e.g., using Jest).
    ```bash
    npm run test
    # or
    yarn test
    ```
-   `test:watch`: Runs unit tests in watch mode.
-   `test:e2e`: Runs end-to-end tests.

## 6. Database Setup (Supabase)

-   Ensure your Supabase instance (either cloud or local via Supabase CLI) has the necessary tables and schema. Refer to any database migration scripts (e.g., in a `supabase/migrations` folder) or schema definitions (`sssync-db.md` or SQL files) in the project.
-   If you're using a shared development Supabase instance, ensure your `.env` points to it correctly.
-   For a fresh Supabase project, you might need to run initial schema migrations. If using Supabase CLI locally:
    ```bash
    # Link to your remote project (one-time)
    # supabase link --project-ref YOUR_PROJECT_ID
    # supabase db pull # If schema exists remotely and you want to sync locally
    # supabase start # To start local Supabase services
    # supabase db reset # To apply local migrations
    # supabase db push # To apply local changes to remote (use with caution)
    ```

## Next Steps

With the backend running, you can:

-   Explore the API endpoints using a tool like Postman, Insomnia, or Bruno (refer to the API Reference section of this documentation or `openapi.json`).
-   Connect a frontend application if available.
-   Start working on new features or bug fixes!

If you encounter any issues during setup, double-check your `.env` configuration, Node.js/npm versions, and consult with other team members or the project's issue tracker.
