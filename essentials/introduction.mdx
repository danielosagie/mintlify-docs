Welcome to the Developer Essentials section for the sssync backend project!

This part of the documentation is designed to help new engineers get up to speed quickly. Here, you'll find:

- **Project Overview**: Understanding the "what" and "why" of sssync.
- **Getting Started**: How to set up your development environment, including `.env` configuration, installing dependencies, and running the application.
- **Backend Architecture**: A dive into the structure of our NestJS backend, including the request lifecycle, key modules, services, data flow, and interaction with Supabase.

Our goal is to provide a clear and actionable guide to make your onboarding process as smooth as possible. If you find anything unclear or missing, please don't hesitate to suggest improvements!
