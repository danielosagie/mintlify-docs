Understanding the organization of the `sssync-bknd` project is key to navigating the codebase and contributing effectively. This backend is built using the [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) framework, which promotes a modular and organized architecture.

Below is a typical layout of the `src` directory and an explanation of its main components:

```

### Key Concepts in NestJS Structure:

*   **Modules (`*.module.ts`):** Encapsulate a specific domain or feature (e.g., `AuthModule`, `ProductsModule`). They organize controllers, services, and providers.
*   **Controllers (`*.controller.ts`):** Handle incoming HTTP requests, route them to appropriate services, and return responses. They are decorated with `@Controller()`.
*   **Services (`*.service.ts`):** Contain the business logic. They are decorated with `@Injectable()` and are typically injected into controllers or other services.
*   **DTOs (Data Transfer Objects - often in `dto/` subdirectories):** Define the shape of data for requests and responses. Class-validator is often used with DTOs for input validation.
*   **Guards (`guards/`):** Implement authorization logic (e.g., checking if a user has the right permissions or a valid session).
*   **Interfaces (`interfaces/` or `types/`):** Define TypeScript data structures.
*   **Entities/Models (if using an ORM like TypeORM):** Would typically be in a `entities/` or `model/` directory within a feature module, or a top-level `database/` directory. For sssync, Supabase interactions are often handled within services directly.

This modular structure helps in maintaining separation of concerns and makes the application easier to scale and test. When working on a new feature or fixing a bug, you can usually identify the relevant module and then dive into its controllers and services.
