Welcome to the sssync API Quickstart guide! This page will help you get up and running with our **Node.js/NestJS backend API** so you can start making calls and integrating with our services.

The sssync API enables you to manage multi-channel e-commerce operations, synchronize product data, handle platform connections, and much more.

## 1. Set Up Your Backend Environment

Before you can make API calls effectively (especially for anything beyond public, unauthenticated endpoints, if any), you'll typically want the backend running locally or have access to a development instance.

-   **Core Technologies**: Our backend is built with Node.js and the NestJS framework using TypeScript.
-   **Detailed Setup**: For comprehensive instructions on cloning the repository, installing dependencies (Node.js, npm/yarn), configuring your `.env` file (for database connections, API keys, etc.), and running the NestJS development server, please refer to our main development guide:

## 2. Understand Authentication

Most sssync API endpoints are protected and require authentication.

-   **Method**: We use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) Bearer tokens.
-   **Obtaining Tokens**: Tokens are typically obtained via Supabase Auth flows.
-   **Usage**: Include the token in the `Authorization` header of your requests:
    ```http
    Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>
    ```

For more details on authentication, refer to the API Introduction:

## 3. Explore API Endpoints

Once your environment is set up and you understand authentication, you can explore the available API endpoints:

-   **API Reference Pages**: The sidebar of this documentation contains detailed pages for each API resource/controller (e.g., Products, Auth, Sync Engine). These pages describe the endpoints, expected parameters, request bodies, and response schemas.
-   **OpenAPI Specification**: For a complete technical overview, refer to our OpenAPI specification file. This file powers the interactive API explorer and can be used to generate client SDKs.

      href="./api-reference/openapi.json"
    >
      Access the full OpenAPI 3.1.0 specification for all endpoints and schemas.
    </Card>

## 4. Make Your First API Call

1.  **Obtain a JWT Token**: Follow the authentication flow (e.g., log in via a client application that uses Supabase Auth with the backend).
2.  **Choose an Endpoint**: Select a simple `GET` endpoint from the API Reference section to start with. For example, if there's an endpoint to list your platform connections (`GET /platform-connections`), that could be a good first call.
3.  **Use a Tool**: Use a tool like Postman, Insomnia, Bruno, or `curl` to make the request.

    **Example (`curl` - replace with actual endpoint and token):**
    ```bash
    curl -X GET "https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN/platform-connections" \
         -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>"
    ```

    Replace `https://YOUR_API_DOMAIN` with your local development URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3001`) or the deployed API URL, and `<YOUR_JWT_TOKEN>` with your actual token.

4.  **Check the Response**: Review the response status code and body to ensure your request was successful.

## 5. Next Steps

-   **Dive Deeper**: Explore the "Developer Essentials" section for a deeper understanding of the [Backend Architecture](./essentials/backend-architecture.mdx) and [Project Overview](./essentials/project-overview.mdx).
-   **Full API Reference**: Consult the individual pages under "API Reference" for specifics on each endpoint you need to use.

Happy coding! If you have questions, refer to the relevant sections of this documentation or reach out to the sssync development team.
