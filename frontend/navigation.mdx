Navigation within the sssync mobile application is handled by the `react-navigation` library. The primary configuration and setup for navigation are located in `sssync_mobile_test/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`.

## Core Concepts

-   **Navigators**: `react-navigation` uses different types of navigators to define various navigation patterns (e.g., stack, tabs, drawer).
-   **Screens**: Individual views within the application that users can navigate to.
-   **Routes**: Define the mapping between a name and a screen component.

## Key Navigators in `AppNavigator.tsx`

Based on the outline of `AppNavigator.tsx`, the application likely employs the following navigation structure:

1.  **Root Stack Navigator (`RootStackParamList`)**: This is the top-level navigator that likely manages the overall application flow, potentially switching between authentication screens and the main app content.
    -   It might contain `AuthStack` and `AppStack` as nested navigators.

2.  **Authentication Stack (`AuthStackParamList`, `AuthStack`)**: Handles screens related to user authentication.
    -   **Screens Include**: `InitialScreen`, `OnboardingSlides`, `AuthScreen` (for login/signup).
    -   The `isFirstLaunch` and `devForceOnboarding` props suggest conditional rendering of onboarding slides.

3.  **Main Application Stack (`AppStackParamList`, `AppStack`)**: Contains the core authenticated experience of the application.
    -   It likely takes an `initialScreenName` prop to determine whether to start at `CreateAccountScreen` or the `TabNavigator`.
    -   **Screens Include**: `CreateAccountScreen`, `ProductDetail`, `PastScans`, `AddListing`.
    -   It also nests the `TabNavigator`.

4.  **Tab Navigator (`TabNavigator`)**: Provides the main bottom tab-based navigation for authenticated users.
    -   **Tabs Likely Include** (inferred from typical app structure and screen names):
        -   `Dashboard`: Navigates to `DashboardScreen`.
        -   `Inventory`: Navigates to `InventoryScreen`.
        -   `Marketplace`: Navigates to `MarketplaceScreen`.
        -   `Orders` (or `InventoryOrders`): Navigates to `OrdersScreen` or `InventoryOrdersScreen`.
        -   `Profile`: Navigates to `ProfileScreen`.
    -   Custom tab bar component (`TabBar.tsx`) might be used for styling and custom icons.

## Navigation Flow

-   **App Initialization (`AppNavigator` component)**:
    -   Performs asynchronous setup (`prepare`, `bootstrapAsync`).
    -   Checks for first launch status (`isFirstLaunch`) and developer flags (`devForceOnboarding`).
    -   Checks user authentication state (e.g., presence of a session token).
-   **Conditional Routing**: Based on the authentication state and first launch status, the `AppNavigator` decides which stack to render initially:
    -   If the user is not authenticated: Renders `AuthStack`.
    -   If the user is authenticated:
        -   May first check if a profile needs to be created (navigating to `AppStack` with `initialScreenName: 'CreateAccountScreen'`).
        -   Otherwise, navigates to `AppStack` with `initialScreenName: 'TabNavigator'`, showing the main app interface.
-   **Screen Navigation**: Within each navigator, screens can navigate to other screens using `navigation.navigate('ScreenName', { params })` or other navigation actions provided by `react-navigation`.
-   **Parameters**: Screens can receive parameters via route params (e.g., `ProductDetail` screen expects `productId`).

## Key Files

-   `sssync_mobile_test/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx`: The central hub for all navigation logic and stack definitions.
-   `sssync_mobile_test/src/components/TabBar.tsx`: (If used) Defines the custom appearance and behavior of the bottom tab bar.

## Important Considerations for Developers

-   **Adding New Screens**: When adding a new screen, you'll need to:
    1.  Define it in the appropriate `ParamList` type (e.g., `AppStackParamList`).
    2.  Add it as a `<Stack.Screen>` or `<Tab.Screen>` component within the relevant navigator in `AppNavigator.tsx`.
-   **Navigation Actions**: Use the `useNavigation` hook from `@react-navigation/native` to get access to the navigation object within your screen components.
-   **Type Safety**: Utilize the defined ParamList types for type-safe navigation and parameter passing.
-   **Deep Linking**: Configuration for deep linking (opening specific app screens from URLs) might also be handled within `AppNavigator.tsx` or related Expo configuration files.

Understanding the structure within `AppNavigator.tsx` is crucial for effectively working with the application's flow and adding new navigational elements.
