State management in the sssync mobile application primarily utilizes React's built-in mechanisms, including the Context API for global or shared state, and component-level state (`useState`, `useReducer`) for local UI and data management.

## Global State with React Context

The application employs the React Context API to manage state that needs to be accessible across different parts of the component tree without prop drilling. Key contexts identified include:

### 1. Authentication Context (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

-   **Purpose**: Manages user authentication state, session data, and provides authentication-related functions.
-   **Provider**: `AuthProvider` wraps parts of the application (likely the entire app after initial loading) to make authentication data available.
-   **Consumer**: The `useAuth()` hook provides access to the context's value.
-   **Managed State (Interface: `AuthContextType`, `Session`):
    -   `sessionData`: An object likely containing the current `session` (which includes `access_token`, `platformConnectionId`, etc.) or `null` if not authenticated.
-   **Key Functions/Logic**:
    -   `getSession()`: An asynchronous function called to retrieve and set the current session state, possibly by interacting with `AsyncStorage` or Supabase's session persistence.
    -   The context likely exposes functions to initiate login, logout, and potentially sign up or handle session refreshes, although these are not explicitly detailed in the provided `AuthContext.tsx` outline (it primarily shows session retrieval).

    *Note on `src/context/AuthContext.ts`*: The file `src/context/AuthContext.ts` defines an `AuthContextType` interface with `signIn`, `signOut`, and `signUp` methods. This suggests it might be an intended interface for a more comprehensive `AuthContext` or a related module. The implementation in `AuthContext.tsx` seems to focus more on session data retrieval. Developers should clarify if these two files are complementary, if one is outdated, or if `AuthContext.tsx` is expected to implement the methods defined in `AuthContext.ts`'s interface.*

### 2. Theme Context (`src/context/ThemeContext.tsx`)

-   **Purpose**: Manages the application's visual theme (e.g., light mode, dark mode) and provides theme-related values (colors, fonts, spacing) to components.
-   **Provider**: `ThemeProvider` wraps the application to provide theme data.
-   **Consumer**: The `useTheme()` hook allows components to access the current theme object and potentially a function to toggle the theme.
-   **Managed State**: Likely includes:
    -   The current theme mode (`light` or `dark`).
    -   An object containing theme-specific values (e.g., `colors.primary`, `colors.background`, `fontSizes.body`).
-   **Key Functions/Logic**:
    -   A function to toggle the theme (e.g., `toggleTheme()`).
    -   Logic to persist the selected theme choice (e.g., using `AsyncStorage`).

## Local Component State

For state that is specific to a single component or a small group of related components, standard React state hooks are used:

-   **`useState`**: Used for managing simple state variables like form inputs, loading flags, modal visibility, selected items, etc.
-   **`useReducer`**: Employed for more complex state logic within a component, especially when the next state depends on the previous one or when state updates involve multiple sub-values.

## Navigation State

-   `react-navigation` library manages its own internal state for navigation stacks, active routes, and route parameters. This state is generally accessed and manipulated via the `navigation` prop or hooks like `useNavigation()` and `useRoute()`.

## Data Fetching and Server Cache State

-   While not explicitly detailed as a global state management tool in the provided outlines, data fetched from the backend API (e.g., user profile, product lists, platform connections) is often stored in local component state.
-   There isn't an explicit mention of a dedicated server cache state management library like React Query or SWR in the provided contexts. Data fetching, caching, and synchronization logic might be handled manually within screens or custom hooks.

## Best Practices and Considerations

-   **Minimize Global State**: Use global context for state that is genuinely global (e.g., authentication, theme). Prefer local state for data that is only relevant to a specific part of the UI.
-   **Context Performance**: Be mindful of performance when using Context, as updates to a context value can cause all consuming components to re-render. Optimize by splitting contexts or using `React.memo` where appropriate.
-   **Clear Separation**: Distinguish between UI state (e.g., loading indicators, input values) and server cache state (data fetched from APIs).
-   **Type Safety**: Leverage TypeScript for defining the shape of state and context values to ensure type safety throughout the application.

This overview provides a foundational understanding of state management in the sssync mobile app. Developers should refer to the specific implementation within each context and screen for more detailed insights.
