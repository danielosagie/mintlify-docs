The `AddListingScreen` is a core component of the sssync mobile application, guiding the user through a multi-step process to create a new product listing. This includes selecting platforms, inputting images, AI-powered analysis and content generation, form review, and finally publishing or saving the listing.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/AddListingScreen.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities & Stages

The screen manages its flow through different stages, defined by the `ListingStage` enum:

-   **`PLATFORM_SELECTION`**: User selects the target e-commerce platforms for the new listing.
-   **`IMAGE_INPUT`**: User captures images/videos using the camera or selects them from the device library. This stage utilizes the `CameraSection` component.
-   **`ANALYZING`**: Loading state shown while the backend's `/products/analyze` endpoint processes the images.
-   **`VISUAL_MATCH`**: Displays visual matches found by the AI analysis, allowing the user to select a relevant match to guide further content generation.
-   **`GENERATING`**: Loading state shown while the backend's `/products/generate-details` endpoint generates product information.
-   **`FORM_REVIEW`**: User reviews and edits the AI-generated (or manually entered) product details for each selected platform. This stage handles complex form interactions and platform-specific fields.
-   **`PUBLISHING`**: Loading state shown while the product is being saved as a draft or published to selected platforms via backend endpoints like `/products/publish` or `/products/{id}/publish/shopify`.

## Core Data Structures & Interfaces

The screen utilizes several important data structures to manage listing data:

-   **`VisualMatch`**: Represents a visual match item returned from image analysis (e.g., from SerpApi).
-   **`BackendAnalysisResponse`**: Structure of the response from the `/products/analyze` backend endpoint.
-   **`GeneratedPlatformDetails`**: A comprehensive interface for product details tailored to specific platforms. It includes common fields (title, description, price, tags, etc.) and platform-specific attributes (e.g., Shopify status, Square GTIN, eBay listing format).
-   **`GenerateDetailsResponse`**: Structure of the response from the `/products/generate-details` backend endpoint, containing generated details mapped by platform key.
-   **`ImageInfo`, `CapturedMediaItem`**: Interfaces for managing image and video media captured or selected by the user.
-   **Shopify-specific interfaces**: `ShopifyLocation`, `ShopifyLocationWithQuantity`, `ShopifyPublishResponse`, `ShopifyOption`, `ShopifyInventoryItem`, `ShopifyInventoryQuantity`, `ShopifyVariant`, `ShopifyProductInput` are used when interacting with Shopify, particularly in the `FORM_REVIEW` stage for publishing.

## Key Props (`AddListingScreenProps`)

-   **`route.params.initialData` (Optional)**: Allows the screen to be initialized with existing listing data for editing purposes. This can include:
    -   `title`, `description`, `price`, `sku`, `barcode`, `images`
    -   `platformDetails`: Pre-existing details for various platforms.
    -   `status`: Shopify product status.
    -   `initialStage`: To start the screen at a specific `ListingStage`.
    -   `productId`, `variantId`: IDs of existing product/variant.
    -   `uploadedImageUrls`: URLs of already uploaded images.

## State Management

The screen manages a significant amount of state, including:

-   `currentStage`: The active `ListingStage`.
-   `selectedPlatforms`: Array of platform keys selected by the user.
-   `capturedMedia`: Array of `CapturedMediaItem` representing user-provided images/videos.
-   `uploadedImageUrls`: URLs of images after uploading to Supabase.
-   `analysisResult`, `generatedDetails`: Data returned from backend AI services.
-   `formData`: An object holding all product details for each platform, structured according to `GeneratedPlatformDetails`.
-   `productId`, `variantId`: IDs for the product and variant being created/edited.
-   Loading states (`isLoading`, `isAnalyzing`, `isGenerating`, `isPublishing`).
-   Modal visibility states (e.g., `platformModalVisible`, `publishModalVisible`).
-   Shopify-specific state: `shopifyLocations`, `selectedShopifyLocationsWithQuantities`.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **Navigation between Stages**: Functions like `handlePlatformsSelected`, `handleMediaCaptured`, `triggerImageAnalysis`, `triggerDetailsGeneration`, `handleProceedWithoutMatch`, `handleSelectMatchForGeneration` manage transitions between `ListingStage`s.
-   **Media Handling**:
    -   Uses `CameraSection` component for capturing media.
    -   `takePicture()`, `startRecording()`, `stopRecording()`: Camera operations.
    -   `pickImagesFromLibrary()`: Selects media from the device library.
    -   `handleSetCover()`, `handleRemoveMedia()`: Manage the list of captured media.
    -   `uploadImagesToSupabase()`: Uploads media to Supabase storage and returns URLs.
-   **API Interactions**:
    -   `triggerImageAnalysis()`: Calls the `/products/analyze` backend endpoint.
    -   `triggerDetailsGeneration()`: Calls the `/products/generate-details` backend endpoint.
    -   `handleSaveDraft()`: Saves the current listing as a draft (likely calls `/products/publish` with appropriate intent).
    -   `handlePublishAction()`: Publishes the product to selected platforms (calls `/products/publish` or platform-specific publish endpoints like `/products/:id/publish/shopify`).
    -   `fetchShopifyLocations()`: Fetches Shopify locations if Shopify is a selected platform.
-   **Form Management (`FORM_REVIEW` stage)**:
    -   `handleFormUpdate()`: Updates the `formData` state when the user edits fields.
    -   Dynamic rendering of form fields based on selected platforms and their specific requirements.
    -   Handles Shopify-specific logic like location selection and quantity input (`updateLocationQuantity`, `handleLocationToggle`).
-   **Modal Handling**: Functions like `renderAddPlatformModal`, `renderPublishModal` control the display of various modals for user interaction.
-   **Rendering Logic**: `renderCurrentStage()` dynamically renders the UI corresponding to the active `ListingStage`. Each stage has its own render function (e.g., `renderPlatformSelection()`, `renderImageInput()`, `renderVisualMatch()`, `renderFormReview()`).

## User Interactions

-   Selecting platforms.
-   Capturing or picking images/videos.
-   Selecting a visual match from AI suggestions or proceeding without one.
-   Editing product details in a multi-platform form.
-   Choosing to save as draft or publish live.
-   For Shopify: Selecting locations and setting inventory quantities.

## Error Handling & Loading States

The screen extensively uses loading state variables (e.g., `isAnalyzing`, `isGenerating`, `isPublishing`) to provide feedback to the user during asynchronous operations. Error handling for API calls is implemented to inform the user of any issues.

## Usage Example

`AddListingScreen` is typically presented as a screen within a stack navigator. It can be navigated to directly or with `initialData` parameters if editing an existing listing (e.g., from `PastScansScreen`).

```tsx
// Example: Integrating AddListingScreen into an AppStack navigator
import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import AddListingScreen from '../screens/AddListingScreen';
import PastScansScreen from '../screens/PastScansScreen'; // Example screen that might navigate to AddListing

export type AppStackParamList = {
  // ... other screen definitions
  AddListing: { 
    initialData?: {
      title: string;
      description: string;
      price: number;
      sku: string;
      barcode: string;
      images: string[];
      platformDetails: any; // Or a more specific type
      status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'archived';
      initialStage?: string; // Corresponds to ListingStage enum values
      productId?: string;
      variantId?: string;
      uploadedImageUrls?: string[];
    };
  };
  PastScans: undefined;
};

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<AppStackParamList>();

const AppStack = () => {
  return (
    <Stack.Navigator>
      {/* ... other screens in the stack ... */}
      <Stack.Screen 
        name="AddListing"
        component={AddListingScreen}
        options={{ title: 'Add New Listing' }} 
      />
      <Stack.Screen 
        name="PastScans" 
        component={PastScansScreen} 
        options={{ title: 'Past Scans' }} 
      />
      {/* ... */}
    </Stack.Navigator>
  );
};

// To navigate to AddListingScreen:
// navigation.navigate('AddListing'); // For a new listing
// navigation.navigate('AddListing', { initialData: myExistingListingData }); // For editing
```

This screen is a complex orchestrator of UI, local state, and backend API calls to provide a comprehensive product listing creation experience.
