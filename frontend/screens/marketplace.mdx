The `MarketplaceScreen` provides a UI for users to browse products, ostensibly from an external marketplace or a curated list. The current version uses mock data for display and includes a feature to simulate adding these items to the user's inventory.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/MarketplaceScreen.tsx`.

**Note:** This screen currently uses `mockMarketplaceItems` for its data source. The `handleAddToInventory` function logs to the console and does not perform a real inventory update.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Display Marketplace Items**: Shows a grid of products using `mockMarketplaceItems`.
    -   Each item is rendered by the `MarketplaceItem` component.
    -   Displays item title, price, seller, and an image placeholder colored by platform.
    -   Items can be tapped to navigate to a `ProductDetail` screen (passing item data).
-   **Category Filtering**: Displays a horizontal list of category chips (e.g., "All", "Food", "Crafts"). Selecting a category updates the `selectedCategory` state, though actual filtering logic based on this state is not explicitly shown in the provided item rendering path.
-   **Search Functionality**: Includes a search bar to filter marketplace items, updating the `searchQuery` state. The filtering logic based on this state is not explicitly detailed for `mockMarketplaceItems` in the `FlatList` data prop.
-   **Add to Inventory (Simulated)**: Each `MarketplaceItem` has an "add" button that calls `handleAddToInventory(item)`.
    -   `handleAddToInventory(item)`: Currently logs a message to the console indicating the item was "added".
-   **Static Sections**: Includes UI sections for "Top Sellers" and "Browse Categories" which appear to be static or use mock representations.

## Core Components & Props

-   **`MarketplaceItem` Component**:
    -   `item`: The marketplace product data object (from `mockMarketplaceItems`).
    -   `onAddToInventory`: Callback function (`handleAddToInventory` from `MarketplaceScreen`).
    -   `navigation`: React Navigation prop, used to navigate to `ProductDetail` on item press.
-   **`MarketplaceScreen` Props**:
    -   `navigation`: Standard React Navigation prop for screen-level navigation.

## State Management

-   `searchQuery`: Stores the current text in the search bar.
-   `selectedCategory`: Stores the currently selected category chip.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **`getPlatformColor(platform)`**: Utility function to return a color based on the platform string (e.g., "Shopify", "Amazon"). Used for placeholder image backgrounds in `MarketplaceItem`.
-   **`handleAddToInventory(item)`**: As mentioned, currently logs to console. In a full implementation, this would likely navigate to an `AddListingScreen` with `item` data or call a backend API.

## Usage Example

`MarketplaceScreen` is typically incorporated into a Tab Navigator as a primary section of the app.

```tsx
// Example in a Tab Navigator (e.g., AppNavigator.tsx)
import MarketplaceScreen from './path/to/MarketplaceScreen';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons'; // Or your icon library
// ... other imports

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator(); // Or your specific tab navigator

function MainAppTabs() {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator>
      {/* ... other tabs ... */}
      <Tab.Screen
        name="MarketplaceTab" // Name of the route
        component={MarketplaceScreen}
        options={{
          title: 'Marketplace', // Title displayed in the tab bar
          tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
            <Icon name="compass-outline" color={color} size={size} />
          ),
        }}
      />
      {/* ... other tabs ... */}
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
}

export default MainAppTabs;
```

## UI Components

-   Uses `FlatList` in a two-column grid to display marketplace items.
-   Custom components: `Card`, `PlaceholderImage`, `Button`.
-   Icons from `react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons`.
-   Animated views from `react-native-reanimated` for item entry.
-   Includes `ScrollView` for horizontal category chips.
