The `InitialScreen` serves as the very first visual entry point when the sssync mobile application starts, before any authentication or onboarding checks are performed by the main navigator.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/InitialScreen.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Welcome Display**: Shows a branded welcome message and introductory text.
    -   It features the app logo and a tagline: "Sync Everywhere, List Faster, Work Together."
    -   Subheading: "Make your inventory work for you."
-   **Font Loading**: Uses `expo-font` to load custom fonts (`PlusJakartaSans_500Medium`, `PlusJakartaSans_700Bold`, `PlusJakartaSans_800ExtraBold`). It displays the `AnimatedGradientBackground` while fonts are loading.
-   **Navigation to Onboarding**: Contains a "Continue" button that navigates the user to the `OnboardingSlides` screen.
-   **Terms & Privacy Link**: Displays text indicating agreement to Terms & Privacy Policy upon continuing, though an actual link might not be implemented directly on this button.

## Props (`Props`)

-   **`navigation`**: The React Navigation prop, used here specifically to navigate to `OnboardingSlides`.

## State Management

-   **`fontsLoaded`**: A boolean state from `useFonts` to determine if the custom fonts have been loaded. The main content is only rendered after fonts are loaded.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   An empty `useEffect` hook is present but not currently used for any specific logic on mount/unmount.
-   The primary logic is the conditional rendering based on `fontsLoaded` and the `onPress` handler of the "Continue" button which calls `navigation.navigate('OnboardingSlides')`.

## User Interactions

-   Viewing the welcome content.
-   Tapping the "Continue" button to proceed to the onboarding slides.

## Relationship with `AppNavigator.tsx`

-   The `InitialScreen` is typically the first screen in the `AuthStack` within `AppNavigator.tsx` if `isFirstLaunch` (or a similar flag like `devForceInitialScreen`) is true, or if no other initial route takes precedence before authentication checks.
-   The actual complex bootstrapping logic (checking authentication state, previous onboarding completion) is handled in `AppNavigator.tsx` by functions like `bootstrapAsync` and `checkOnboardingAndNavigate`. `InitialScreen` primarily serves as a static entry point before those checks direct the user further.

## Usage Example

`InitialScreen` is typically defined as a route within the `AuthStack` in the main navigation setup.

```tsx
// Example: Integrating InitialScreen into an AuthStack navigator
// In sssync_mobile_test/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx or similar

import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import InitialScreen from '../screens/InitialScreen';
import OnboardingSlides from '../screens/OnboardingSlides';
import AuthScreen from '../screens/AuthScreen';

export type AuthStackParamList = {
  InitialScreen: undefined;
  OnboardingSlides: undefined;
  Auth: undefined;
};

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<AuthStackParamList>();

// This simplified AuthStack always shows InitialScreen first in this example
// In the actual AppNavigator, its presentation might be conditional (e.g., only on first launch)
const AuthStackComponent = () => (
  <Stack.Navigator screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
    <Stack.Screen name="InitialScreen" component={InitialScreen} />
    <Stack.Screen name="OnboardingSlides" component={OnboardingSlides} />
    <Stack.Screen name="Auth" component={AuthScreen} />
  </Stack.Navigator>
);

// This AuthStackComponent would then be used in a RootNavigator based on session state:
// if (!session) { // If no active session
//   return <RootStack.Screen name="AuthStack" component={AuthStackComponent} />;
// }
```

This screen provides the initial brand presentation and funnels users into the onboarding sequence.
