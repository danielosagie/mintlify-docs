The `ProductDetailScreen` is responsible for displaying comprehensive information about a single product. Users typically navigate to this screen from a product list (e.g., `MarketplaceScreen`). The current implementation displays data passed to it via route parameters rather than fetching it dynamically.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/ProductDetail.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Display Product Information**: Shows details of a product based on the `item` object received in `route.params`.
    -   Product title
    -   Price
    -   Platform
    -   Image (uses a placeholder if `item.image` is not available).
    -   Stats section for Sales, Rating, and Views (from `item.sales`, `item.rating`, `item.views`).
-   **Navigation**: Includes a back button in the header to return to the previous screen.
-   **Action Buttons (UI Only)**: Displays "Edit Listing" and "View Analytics" buttons. The `onPress` handlers for these buttons are not currently implemented in the provided code.

## Route Params

-   **`route.params.item`**: The screen expects an `item` object to be passed as a route parameter. This object should contain the product details to be displayed (e.g., `title`, `price`, `platform`, `image`, `sales`, `rating`).
    -   If `route.params` or `route.params.item` is undefined, it defaults to an empty object, and the screen will display placeholder values.

## Props

-   **`route`**: The React Navigation route prop, used to access `route.params.item`.
-   **`navigation`**: The React Navigation prop, used for the back button (`navigation.goBack()`).

## State Management

-   This screen is currently stateless regarding the product data itself, as it relies entirely on the `item` prop passed via `route.params`.
-   It does not manage `isLoading` or `error` states related to data fetching, as no data fetching occurs within the component.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   The component primarily focuses on rendering the data from the `item` prop.
-   No internal data fetching logic (e.g., `fetchProductDetails`) is present in the current version.

## Usage Example

`ProductDetailScreen` is navigated to from other screens, typically by passing an `item` object containing the product data.

```tsx
// Example of navigating to ProductDetailScreen (e.g., from MarketplaceScreen.tsx)

// In MarketplaceItem component (part of MarketplaceScreen.tsx):
// ...
// <TouchableOpacity 
//   style={styles.gridItem}
//   onPress={() => {
//     // 'item' here is the specific marketplace item from the list
//     navigation.getParent()?.navigate('ProductDetail', { item }); 
//   }}
// >
// ...


// In AppNavigator.tsx (part of AppStackParamList):
// export type AppStackParamList = {
//   // ... other screens
//   ProductDetail: { item: any }; // Define that ProductDetail expects an 'item' param
//   Marketplace: undefined; // Assuming MarketplaceScreen is also in this stack
// };
```

When a user taps on an item in `MarketplaceScreen`, it navigates to `ProductDetailScreen`, passing the selected `item` object.

## UI Components

-   `ScrollView` to allow content to be scrollable.
-   `Image` component for the product image.
-   Standard `Text` and `View` components for layout and information display.
-   Custom `Button` component for action buttons.
-   Icons from `react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons` for header and platform info.

This screen provides a focused view of a single product. Future enhancements might include fetching more detailed data dynamically based on a `productId` and implementing the action buttons.
