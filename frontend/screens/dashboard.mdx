The `DashboardScreen` serves as the central hub or main landing page for users after they have successfully logged into the sssync mobile application.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/DashboardScreen.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities

While the provided outline is minimal, a typical dashboard screen in this context would likely feature:

-   **Summary Information**: Displaying key metrics or summaries relevant to the user, such as:
    -   Number of connected platforms.
    -   Overall sync status or recent sync activity.
    -   Quick overview of inventory levels or recent orders.
    -   Alerts or notifications requiring user attention.
-   **Quick Actions/Navigation**: Providing easy access to common tasks or important sections of the app, such as:
    -   Button to add a new product listing.
    -   Links to manage platform connections.
    -   Shortcuts to inventory or orders sections.
-   **Data Visualization (Potentially)**: Charts or graphs summarizing sales data, inventory trends, or platform performance (e.g., using `react-native-chart-kit` if integrated here).
-   **Welcome Message/User Information**: Personalizing the experience with a greeting.

## State Management

The `DashboardScreen` would manage state related to:

-   Data fetched for display (e.g., connection statuses, summary counts, recent activity feeds).
-   Loading indicators while fetching data.
-   Error states if data fetching fails.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **Data Fetching**: On screen mount (e.g., using `useEffect`), it would likely make one or more asynchronous API calls to the backend to retrieve the data needed for display.
-   **Data Processing/Formatting**: Transforming raw data from the API into a display-friendly format.
-   **Navigation Handlers**: Functions to navigate to other screens when quick action buttons or links are tapped.

## User Interactions

-   Viewing summarized information and metrics.
-   Tapping on quick action buttons or links to navigate to other parts of the app.
-   Potentially interacting with charts or data visualizations (e.g., filtering, drilling down).

## Error Handling & Feedback

-   Displaying loading indicators while data is being fetched.
-   Showing appropriate error messages or placeholder content if data fetching fails or if there's no data to display.

## Usage Example

`DashboardScreen` is typically used as a route within a navigator, often as the initial screen in a Tab Navigator or a Stack Navigator after login.

```tsx
// Example: Integrating DashboardScreen into a Tab Navigator
import React from 'react';
import { createBottomTabNavigator } from '@react-navigation/bottom-tabs';
import DashboardScreen from '../screens/DashboardScreen';
import InventoryScreen from '../screens/InventoryScreen';
import ProfileScreen from '../screens/ProfileScreen';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons'; // Or your preferred icon library

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator();

const MainTabNavigator = () => {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator
      screenOptions={({ route }) => ({
        tabBarIcon: ({ focused, color, size }) => {
          let iconName;
          if (route.name === 'Dashboard') {
            iconName = focused ? 'view-dashboard' : 'view-dashboard-outline';
          } else if (route.name === 'Inventory') {
            iconName = focused ? 'package-variant-closed' : 'package-variant';
          } else if (route.name === 'Profile') {
            iconName = focused ? 'account-circle' : 'account-circle-outline';
          }
          return <Icon name={iconName} size={size} color={color} />;
        },
        tabBarActiveTintColor: '#16A34A', // Example color
        tabBarInactiveTintColor: 'gray',
        headerShown: false, // Usually, screens in tabs manage their own headers
      })}
    >
      <Tab.Screen name="Dashboard" component={DashboardScreen} />
      <Tab.Screen name="Inventory" component={InventoryScreen} />
      {/* Add other tab screens like Orders, Marketplace, etc. */}
      <Tab.Screen name="Profile" component={ProfileScreen} />
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
};

export default MainTabNavigator;

// In your AppNavigator.tsx or similar root navigation file:
// ...
// <Stack.Screen name="AppTabs" component={MainTabNavigator} />
// ...
```

As the main entry point post-login, the `DashboardScreen` plays a vital role in providing users with an at-a-glance overview of their e-commerce operations within sssync and guiding them to relevant features.
