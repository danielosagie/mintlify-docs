The `AuthScreen` provides the primary interface for user authentication, allowing users to sign in to their existing accounts or navigate to the account creation process.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/AuthScreen.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities

-   **User Login**: Allows users to log in using their email and password.
-   **User Sign Up**: Allows new users to create an account with their name, email, and password.
-   **Navigation to Sign Up/Log In**: Toggles between login and sign-up forms.
-   **Password Recovery**: Includes functionality to initiate a password recovery process (e.g., "Forgot Password?").

## Props (`AuthScreenProps`)

-   **`navigation`**: The standard React Navigation prop used for navigating to other screens (e.g., `TabNavigator` upon successful login, or `CreateAccountScreen` for new users - though navigation is often handled by the `AuthContext` side effects).

## State Management

The screen manages local state for:

-   User input fields: `email`, `password`, `firstName`, `lastName`.
-   Loading indicators: `loading` (to provide feedback during authentication attempts).
-   UI toggles: `isLogin` (to switch between login and sign-up forms).

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **`handleAuth()`**: This is the primary function triggered when the user attempts to log in or sign up.
    -   Performs basic input validation (e.g., checking if name fields are filled for sign-up).
    -   If `isLogin` is true, calls `supabase.auth.signInWithPassword(...)`.
    -   If `isLogin` is false, calls `supabase.auth.signUp(...)` with email, password, and user metadata (firstName, lastName).
    -   Handles responses: 
        -   On successful login/signup where a session is established, it calls `authContext.signIn(session.access_token)`. The `AppNavigator` typically observes `AuthContext` changes to automatically navigate to the main app.
        -   On error: Displays an `Alert` with the error message.
    -   Manages the `loading` state.

-   **`handleForgotPassword()`**: Initiates the password recovery process.
    -   Prompts the user for their email address if not already entered.
    -   Calls `supabase.auth.resetPasswordForEmail(...)`.
    -   Provides feedback via an `Alert`.

## User Interactions

-   Entering email, password, first name, and last name.
-   Tapping the "Log In" or "Sign Up" button.
-   Tapping links to switch between "Sign Up" and "Log In" forms.
-   Tapping "Forgot Password?".

## Error Handling & Feedback

-   Displays `Alert` pop-ups for errors (e.g., invalid credentials, user already exists, network issues).
-   Uses a loading indicator within the primary action `Button` while authentication requests are in progress.

## Usage Example

`AuthScreen` is a key part of the authentication flow, usually presented before the main application content if the user is not authenticated. It's typically part of an "Auth Stack" in navigation.

```tsx
// Example: Integrating AuthScreen into an AuthStack navigator
// In sssync_mobile_test/src/navigation/AppNavigator.tsx or similar

import { createNativeStackNavigator } from '@react-navigation/native-stack';
import AuthScreen from '../screens/AuthScreen';
import InitialScreen from '../screens/InitialScreen';
import OnboardingSlides from '../screens/OnboardingSlides';
// import CreateAccountScreen from '../screens/CreateAccountScreen'; // Might be part of AppStack post-auth

// Assuming AuthStackParamList is defined as in your AppNavigator.tsx
type AuthStackParamList = {
  InitialScreen: undefined;
  OnboardingSlides: undefined;
  Auth: undefined;
};

const Stack = createNativeStackNavigator<AuthStackParamList>();

const AuthStack = ({ isFirstLaunch, devForceOnboarding }: { isFirstLaunch: boolean, devForceOnboarding: boolean }) => (
  <Stack.Navigator screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
    {(isFirstLaunch || devForceOnboarding) && (
      <Stack.Screen name="OnboardingSlides" component={OnboardingSlides} />
    )}
    <Stack.Screen name="Auth" component={AuthScreen} />
    {/* Other screens like a dedicated ForgotPasswordScreen could be here */}
  </Stack.Navigator>
);

// This AuthStack is then used in a root navigator conditionally based on auth state.
// For example, in AppNavigator.tsx:
// ...
// {session ? (
//   <RootStack.Screen name="AppStack" component={AppStack} initialParams={{ initialScreenName }} />
// ) : (
//   <RootStack.Screen name="AuthStack" component={AuthStackComponent} />
// )}
// ...
```

This screen is critical for user access, interacting closely with Supabase for authentication and the `AuthContext` to manage and propagate the session state across the application, which in turn drives navigation changes in `AppNavigator`.
