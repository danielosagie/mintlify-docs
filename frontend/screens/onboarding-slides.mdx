The `OnboardingSlides` screen is presented to new users, typically after an initial splash or welcome screen (like `InitialScreen.tsx`), to introduce the app's key features and benefits through a series of swipeable slides.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/OnboardingSlides.tsx`.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Display Slides**: Renders a sequence of three predefined informational slides. Each slide contains an image (`../assets/`), title, and descriptive text.
    -   The slides are defined in a `slides` array within the component.
    -   Uses a memoized `OnboardingSlide` sub-component to render individual slides.
-   **Navigation through Slides**: Allows users to swipe horizontally to move between slides. Progress is indicated by pagination dots.
-   **Skip Onboarding**: A "Skip" button in the header allows users to bypass the slides and navigate directly to the `AuthScreen`.
-   **Proceed/Complete Onboarding**: A "Next" button advances to the next slide. On the last slide, this button changes to "Get Started" and navigates the user to the `AuthScreen`.

## Props

-   **`navigation`**: The React Navigation prop, used to navigate to the `AuthScreen` once onboarding is completed or skipped.

## State Management

-   **`currentIndex`**: Stores the index of the currently displayed slide, used for updating pagination dots and button text.
-   **`flatListRef`**: A `useRef` hook to control the `FlatList` for programmatic scrolling (e.g., when "Next" is pressed).

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **`renderItem({ item })`**: A function passed to the `FlatList` to render each `OnboardingSlide` component.
-   **`handleNext()`**: 
    -   If not on the last slide, scrolls the `FlatList` to the next slide and updates `currentIndex`.
    -   If on the last slide, navigates to the `Auth` screen.
-   **`handleSkip()`**: 
    -   Navigates the user to the `Auth` screen.
-   **`onMomentumScrollEnd` (on `FlatList`)**: Updates `currentIndex` based on the user's swipe gesture to keep pagination in sync.

## UI Components

-   Uses a `FlatList` with `horizontal` and `pagingEnabled` props to create the swipeable slide carousel.
-   `AnimatedGradientBackground`: Provides a dynamic background for the screen.
-   `Button`: Custom button component for "Next" / "Get Started".
-   Pagination dots are rendered dynamically based on the number of slides and the `currentIndex`.

## Usage Example

The `OnboardingSlides` screen is typically part of an authentication or initial setup stack in the navigation. It's often shown conditionally based on whether the user is new or has already completed onboarding.

```tsx
// Example in an Auth Stack Navigator (e.g., AppNavigator.tsx)
import InitialScreen from './path/to/InitialScreen';
import OnboardingSlides from './path/to/OnboardingSlides';
import AuthScreen from './path/to/AuthScreen';
// ... other imports

const Auth = createNativeStackNavigator(); // Or your specific stack navigator

// This assumes `isFirstLaunch` is determined, perhaps from AsyncStorage
// or some other mechanism to check if onboarding has been completed.
const AuthStack = ({ isFirstLaunch, devForceOnboarding }) => (
  <Auth.Navigator screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
    {/* 
      The InitialScreen might decide to navigate to OnboardingSlides or Auth directly 
      based on checks like auth state or if onboarding was completed.
      Alternatively, OnboardingSlides could be the initial route if always shown to new users.
    */}
    <Auth.Screen name="InitialScreen" component={InitialScreen} />
    <Auth.Screen name="OnboardingSlides" component={OnboardingSlides} />
    <Auth.Screen name="Auth" component={AuthScreen} />
    {/* ... other screens in auth flow like CreateAccountScreen ... */}
  </Auth.Navigator>
);

export default AuthStack;
```

In this flow, `InitialScreen` might navigate to `OnboardingSlides`, which then navigates to `AuthScreen` upon completion or skip.

This screen is crucial for a positive first-time user experience, providing a quick and engaging introduction to the sssync app's value proposition.
