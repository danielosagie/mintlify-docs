The `InventoryScreen` serves a dual purpose: displaying the user's product inventory and guiding the user through the initial synchronization process for new platform connections. It includes a multi-step workflow for scanning platform data, reviewing mapping suggestions, and activating the sync.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/InventoryScreen.tsx`.

**Note:** The current implementation features a placeholder `apiClient` for backend calls and uses `mockInventoryItems` for the main inventory display when not in the migration/sync flow or when viewing the demo.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Inventory Display (Demo/Synced State)**:
    -   Shows a list of inventory items (currently `mockInventoryItems` or an empty state).
    -   Each item can display an image (or placeholder), title, price, quantity, and platform badges.
    -   Includes search, filter (by platform), and sort functionalities for the inventory list.
    -   A Floating Action Button (FAB) to navigate to an "Add Listing" screen (navigation action not yet implemented).
-   **Initial Platform Sync Workflow**:
    -   **Prompt**: If no synced connections are detected, prompts the user to start their first sync/migration.
    -   **`startInitialScan(connectionId)`**: Initiates an initial product scan on a platform by calling `POST /sync/connections/{connectionId}/start-scan`.
    -   **`pollConnectionStatus(connectionId, targetState)`**: Periodically calls `GET /platform-connections/{connectionId}` to check the connection status, waiting for it to reach a `targetState` (e.g., `needs_review` after scan, or `active`/`syncing` after activation).
    -   **`fetchScanResults(connectionId)`**: After successful scan, retrieves scan summary (`GET /sync/connections/{connectionId}/scan-summary`) and mapping suggestions (`GET /sync/connections/{connectionId}/mapping-suggestions`).
    -   **Review UI (Placeholder)**: A section for users to review scan summaries and mapping suggestions. The actual UI for reviewing and modifying mappings is marked as a TODO.
    -   **`submitConfirmedMappings(connectionId, confirmedMatches)`**: Sends user-confirmed product mappings via `POST /sync/connections/{connectionId}/confirm-mappings`. Currently sends dummy data.
    -   **`activateSync(connectionId)`**: Triggers the full initial synchronization via `POST /sync/connections/{connectionId}/activate-sync`.
-   **Status Display**: Renders UI feedback for different stages of the sync workflow (`scanning`, `reviewing`, `confirming`, `activating`, `error`).
-   **Demo Mode**: Allows viewing a demo inventory using `mockInventoryItems` if the sync process is not active.

## Core Data Structures & Interfaces

-   **`InventoryItemData`**: Defines the structure for individual inventory items (used with mock data).
-   **`ConnectionStatusResponse`**: Expected structure for responses from `GET /platform-connections/{connectionId}`.
-   **`ConfirmMappingsDto`**: Defines the payload for `submitConfirmedMappings`.

## State Management

Key state variables include:

-   `searchQuery`, `filter`, `sort`: For inventory list controls.
-   `showDemo`: Toggles the demo inventory view.
-   `hasSyncedConnections`: Tracks if any platform connection is considered active/synced.
-   `migrationState`: Manages the current stage of the sync workflow (e.g., `idle`, `prompt`, `scanning`, `reviewing`, `error`).
-   `activeConnectionId`: Stores the ID of the platform connection currently undergoing the sync process.
-   `scanSummary`, `mappingSuggestions`: To store data fetched during the sync workflow.
-   `migrationError`: Stores error messages related to the sync process.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **Inventory Display Components**:
    -   `InventoryItem` component: Renders each item in the list.
    -   `getPlatformColor()`: Utility to get platform-specific colors.
    -   `renderSortLabel()`: Renders UI text for current sort option.
-   **Initial Platform Sync Workflow Functions**:
    -   `useEffect` hook: Checks connection status on load to determine if the sync prompt should be shown.
    -   The sequence: `startInitialScan` -> `pollConnectionStatus` (for `needs_review`) -> `fetchScanResults` -> (User Review UI - TODO) -> `submitConfirmedMappings` -> `activateSync` -> `pollConnectionStatus` (for `active`/`syncing`).
    -   `renderMigrationStatus()`: Renders different UI components based on the `migrationState`.
-   **API Interactions**: Uses a placeholder `apiClient` to simulate calls to backend sync-related endpoints.

## Usage Example

`InventoryScreen` is typically used as one of the main screens in a Tab Navigator, providing users access to their product list and the platform connection management tools.

```tsx
// Example in a Tab Navigator (e.g., AppNavigator.tsx)
import InventoryScreen from './path/to/InventoryScreen';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons'; // Or your icon library
// ... other imports

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator(); // Or your specific tab navigator

function MainAppTabs() {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator>
      {/* ... other tabs like Dashboard, Orders ... */}
      <Tab.Screen
        name="InventoryTab" // Name of the route
        component={InventoryScreen}
        options={{
          title: 'Inventory', // Title displayed in the tab bar
          tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
            <Icon name="storefront-outline" color={color} size={size} />
          ),
          // headerShown: false, // If header is managed internally or not needed
        }}
      />
      {/* ... other tabs ... */}
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
}

export default MainAppTabs;
```

When a user navigates to this tab, the `InventoryScreen` will initialize its state, check for synced connections, and either display the inventory or guide the user through the initial platform sync process.

## UI Components

-   Uses `FlatList` for inventory display.
-   Custom components: `Card`, `Button`, `PlaceholderImage` (imported as `Placeholder`).
-   Utilizes `ActivityIndicator` for loading states during sync operations.
-   Icons from `react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons`.
-   Animated views from `react-native-reanimated`.
