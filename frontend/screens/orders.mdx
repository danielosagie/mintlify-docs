The `OrdersScreen` is designed to display a list of customer orders. It includes features for searching, filtering by platform and status, and uses mock data for its current implementation.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/OrdersScreen.tsx`.

**Note:** This screen currently uses an extended version of `mockOrders` from `../data/mockData.ts` for its data source.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Display Orders List**: Shows a list of orders, with each order rendered by the `OrderListItem` component.
    -   The list displays mock data, extended for a fuller view.
    -   Includes a static stats section at the top showing "Total Orders", "Total Revenue", and "Pending" counts.
-   **Search**: A search bar allows users to filter orders by order ID, customer name, platform, or status.
-   **Filtering**:
    -   **By Platform**: Displays a horizontal scrollable list of platform tabs (dynamically generated from unique platforms in the mock data, plus "All"). Selecting a platform filters the list.
    -   **By Status**: Displays a horizontal scrollable list of status chips (dynamically generated from unique statuses in the mock data, plus "All"). Selecting a status filters the list.
-   **Pagination (UI Only)**: Includes UI elements for pagination ("Page 1 of 4", previous/next buttons), but the logic for actual pagination is not implemented with the mock data.
-   **Empty State**: If no orders match the filters, an empty state message is displayed with an icon.

## Props

-   The `OrdersScreen` itself does not take explicit navigation props for its primary functionality but would be part of a larger navigation structure (e.g., Tab Navigator).

## State Management

-   `selectedPlatform`: Stores the currently selected platform filter (e.g., "All", "Shopify").
-   `selectedStatus`: Stores the currently selected status filter (e.g., "All", "Delivered").
-   `searchQuery`: Stores the current text from the search input.

## Major Functions & Logic

-   **Filtering Logic**: The `filteredOrders` variable is derived by applying `selectedPlatform`, `selectedStatus`, and `searchQuery` to the `extendedOrders` (mock data).
-   **Dynamic Filters**: `platforms` and `statuses` arrays are dynamically generated from the unique values present in the `extendedOrders` mock data, ensuring filters are relevant to the dataset.
-   The screen uses the `OrderListItem` component (presumably from `../components/OrderListItem.tsx`) to render each order.

## Usage Example

`OrdersScreen` is typically used as a main screen within a Tab Navigator, allowing users to easily access their order history.

```tsx
// Example in a Tab Navigator (e.g., AppNavigator.tsx)
import OrdersScreen from './path/to/OrdersScreen';
import Icon from 'react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons'; // Or your icon library
// ... other imports

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator(); // Or your specific tab navigator

function MainAppTabs() {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator>
      {/* ... other tabs like Dashboard, Inventory ... */}
      <Tab.Screen
        name="OrdersTab" // Name of the route
        component={OrdersScreen}
        options={{
          title: 'Orders', // Title displayed in the tab bar
          tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
            <Icon name="cart-outline" color={color} size={size} />
          ),
        }}
      />
      {/* ... other tabs ... */}
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
}

export default MainAppTabs;
```

## UI Components

-   Uses a `map` function to render `OrderListItem` components within an `Animated.View` for the main list (effectively a custom list rendering, not a `FlatList` for the primary order items, though `FlatList` might be used internally by `OrderListItem` if it were more complex).
-   Custom components: `Card`, `OrderListItem`.
-   Standard React Native components: `View`, `Text`, `TextInput`, `TouchableOpacity`, `ScrollView`.
-   Icons from `react-native-vector-icons/MaterialCommunityIcons`.
-   Animated views from `react-native-reanimated`.

This screen provides users with essential visibility into their sales activities across all connected platforms. Clear presentation of order information and efficient data handling are important for its effectiveness.
