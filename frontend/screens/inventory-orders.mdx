The `InventoryOrdersScreen` provides a consolidated view for users to manage and review their product inventory and customer orders. It features a tabbed interface to switch between "Inventory" and "Orders" lists.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/screens/InventoryOrdersScreen.tsx`.

**Note:** The current implementation of this screen primarily uses mock data (`mockInventoryItems`, `mockOrders`) for demonstration and UI development purposes.

## Key Functionalities

-   **Tabbed Navigation**: Allows users to switch between an "Inventory" view and an "Orders" view.
-   **Inventory Display**:
    -   Shows a grid of inventory items.
    -   Each item can display an image (or a placeholder), title, price, stock quantity, and platform badges.
    -   Includes sections for "Categories" and "Your Activity" (seller stats), currently using static/mock information.
-   **Orders Display**:
    -   Shows a list of orders.
    -   Each order displays ID, platform, customer name, number of items, date, status, and total amount.
    -   Provides "Details" and "Track" action buttons (currently logging to console).
-   **Search Functionality**: A search bar allows users to filter products (in Inventory tab) or orders based on a query.
-   **Filtering**:
    -   For Orders: Chips to filter by status (e.g., "All", "Delivered", "In Transit").
    -   (Inventory filter chips seem to be present but might be intended for order statuses, review needed).

## Data Structures & Props

This screen does not take explicit navigation props for its core content display, as it's designed to be a self-contained part of a larger navigation structure (like a Tab Navigator). It manages its internal state for active tab, search queries, and filters.

It uses mock data structures `mockInventoryItems` and `mockOrders` imported from `../data/mockData.ts`.

## Helper Functions

-   **`renderInventoryItem({ item })`**: Renders a single item in the inventory grid.
-   **`renderOrderItem({ item })`**: Renders a single order card in the orders list.
-   **`getPlatformColor(platform, theme)`**: Returns a specific color based on the platform name (e.g., Shopify, Amazon) and current theme.
-   **`getStatusIcon(status)`**: Returns an appropriate MaterialCommunityIcon name based on the order status string (e.g., 'pending' -> 'timer-sand').
-   **`formatDate(dateString)`**: Formats a date string into a user-friendly representation (e.g., "Today", "Yesterday", or "Oct 28").
-   **`getStatusColor(status, theme)`**: Returns a specific color based on the order status string and theme, typically for badges.
-   **`getRandomColor(id)`**: Returns a pseudo-random color from a predefined list based on an item's ID, used for placeholder image backgrounds.

## Usage Example

The `InventoryOrdersScreen` is typically used as a screen within a Tab Navigator.

```tsx
// Example in a Tab Navigator (e.g., AppNavigator.tsx or a nested TabNavigator)
import InventoryOrdersScreen from './path/to/InventoryOrdersScreen';
// ... other imports

const Tab = createBottomTabNavigator(); // Or your specific tab navigator

function MyTabs() {
  return (
    <Tab.Navigator>
      <Tab.Screen
        name="Inventory" // The tab name might be 'Inventory', 'Items', 'Products & Orders' etc.
        component={InventoryOrdersScreen}
        options={{
          tabBarIcon: ({ color, size }) => (
            <Icon name="view-dashboard-outline" color={color} size={size} />
          ),
          // headerShown: false, // If you want to manage header within the screen itself
        }}
      />
      {/* ... other tabs ... */}
    </Tab.Navigator>
  );
}

export default MyTabs;
```

In this setup, `InventoryOrdersScreen` would handle its own internal state for switching between the inventory and orders views.

## UI Details

-   **Layout**: Uses `FlatList` for displaying both inventory (2 columns) and orders (single column).
-   **Styling**: Leverages `StyleSheet` for component styling and `useTheme` for theme-aware colors.
-   **Animations**: Uses `react-native-reanimated` (`FadeInUp`) for subtle entry animations of content.
-   **Components**: Utilizes custom components like `Card`, `Button`, and `PlaceholderImage`.

This screen is central to providing users with an overview of their operational data. Efficient data fetching, clear presentation, and easy navigation are key for its usability.
