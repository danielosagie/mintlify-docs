The `PlatformSelector` component provides a user interface for selecting one or more e-commerce platforms. This is likely used in contexts such as configuring which platforms to publish a product to, or filtering data by platform.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/components/PlatformSelector.tsx`.

## Purpose

-   To offer a standardized way for users to choose from a list of available e-commerce platforms (e.g., Shopify, Square, Clover, Amazon, eBay).
-   To manage the state of selected platforms and notify a parent component of changes.

## Props

-   **`platforms` (or `selectedPlatforms`): `string[]` (Required)**: An array of platform keys (strings) that are currently selected. The component uses this to highlight the selected platforms.
-   **`onChange: (selectedPlatforms: string[]) => void` (Required)**: A callback function that is invoked when the user's selection of platforms changes. It receives the new array of selected platform keys.
-   **`availablePlatforms?: { key: string; name: string; icon?: string }[]` (Optional)**: An array of objects defining all platforms that can be selected. If not provided, this list might be hardcoded within the component or fetched from a global configuration.
    -   `key`: Unique identifier for the platform (e.g., "shopify").
    -   `name`: Display name for the platform (e.g., "Shopify").
    -   `icon`: Name of an icon to represent the platform.

## Key Features & Logic

-   **Display Platforms**: Renders a list of available platforms, typically showing their name and icon.
-   **Selection State**: Visually indicates which platforms are currently selected (e.g., highlighting, checkmarks).
-   **Toggle Selection (`togglePlatform(platformId)`)**: 
    -   When a user taps on a platform, this function is called with the platform's key (`platformId`).
    -   It updates the internal list of selected platforms: if the platform was already selected, it's removed; otherwise, it's added.
    -   After updating, it calls the `onChange` prop with the new array of selected platform keys.
-   **Visual Customization**: 
    -   `getPlatformColor(platformId)`: May be used to apply platform-specific colors to icons or backgrounds for better visual distinction.
    -   `getIconForPlatform(platform)`: Retrieves the appropriate icon for each platform.

## Implementation Notes

-   The component might render each platform as a touchable button or a chip.
-   It could support single-selection or multi-selection mode, though the `onChange` prop taking an array of strings suggests multi-selection is the primary use case.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import PlatformSelector from '../components/PlatformSelector';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';
import { useState } from 'react';

const availablePlatformsForSelection = [
  { key: 'shopify', name: 'Shopify', icon: 'shopify' },
  { key: 'square', name: 'Square', icon: 'square' },
  { key: 'clover', name: 'Clover', icon: 'clover' },
];

const ProductSettingsScreen = () => {
  const [selectedDestinations, setSelectedDestinations] = useState<string[]>(['shopify']);

  const handlePlatformChange = (newSelection: string[]) => {
    setSelectedDestinations(newSelection);
    console.log('Selected platforms:', newSelection);
  };

  return (
    <View>
      <Text>Select platforms to publish to:</Text>
      <PlatformSelector 
        platforms={selectedDestinations} 
        onChange={handlePlatformChange} 
        availablePlatforms={availablePlatformsForSelection} 
      />
    </View>
  );
};
```

This component simplifies the task of allowing users to make choices from a predefined set of platforms, which is a common requirement in a multi-channel e-commerce application.
