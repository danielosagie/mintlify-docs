The `Card` component is a reusable UI container used throughout the sssync mobile application to group and display related content with a consistent, card-like visual style.

Located at `sssync_mobile_test/src/components/Card.tsx`.

## Purpose

-   To provide a visually distinct container for sections of content or individual items (e.g., list items, summary information).
-   To ensure consistent styling (padding, margins, borders, shadows, background color) for card elements across the app.
-   To simplify the layout by providing a pre-styled wrapper.

## Props

-   **`children: React.ReactNode` (Required)**: The content to be rendered inside the card. This can be any valid React Native elements (text, images, views, other components).
-   **`style?: ViewStyle` (Optional)**: Allows for custom styles to be applied to the card's main container `View`, overriding or extending the default card styles.

## Key Features & Logic

-   **Styling**: 
    -   Applies base styles that define the card's appearance (e.g., background color from the theme, border radius, padding, margin, shadow or elevation for a raised effect).
    -   These base styles are likely sourced from a global theme object or defined directly within the component.
-   **Content Projection**: Renders any `children` passed to it within the styled container.

## Usage Example

```tsx
import Card from '../components/Card';
import { Text, View } from 'react-native';

const MyScreen = () => {
  return (
    <View style={{ padding: 10 }}>
      <Card style={{ marginBottom: 10 }}>
        <Text style={{ fontSize: 18, fontWeight: 'bold' }}>Section Title</Text>
        <Text>This is some content inside a card.</Text>
      </Card>

      <Card>
        <Text>Another card with different content.</Text>
        {/* You can nest other components too */}
      </Card>
    </View>
  );
};
```

This component is a fundamental building block for creating structured and visually appealing layouts in the application.
